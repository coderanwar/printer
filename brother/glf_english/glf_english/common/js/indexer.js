contents[	399	]='External TAD (Telephone Answering Device) You can connect an external Telephone Answering Device (TAD) to the same line as your machine. When the TAD answers a call, your machine will “listen” for the CNG (fax calling) tones sent by a sending fax machine. If it hears them it will take over the call and receive the fax. If it does not hear them, it will let your TAD take a voice message and the display will show Telephone. The external TAD must answer within four rings (we recommend setting it to two rings). This is because your machine cannot hear the CNG tones until the external TAD has picked up the call. The sending machine will send CNG tones for only eight to ten seconds longer. We do not recommend using the toll saver feature on your external TAD if it needs more than four rings to activate it. DO NOT connect a TAD elsewhere on the same telephone line. If you have problems receiving faxes, reduce the Ring Delay setting on your external TAD.';

For example: “After the beep, leave a message or press *51 and Start to send a fax.” We recommend beginning your OGM with an initial 5 second silence because the machine cannot hear fax tones over a loud voice.

Large objects and walls between the two devices and interference from other electronic devices can affect the data transfer speed of your documents. Due to these factors, wireless may not be the best method of connection for all types of documents and applications. If you are printing large files, such as multi-page documents with mixed text and large graphics, you may want to consider selecting wired Ethernet for faster data transfer, or USB for the fastest throughput speed. Although the Brother machine can be used in both a wired and wireless network, only one connection method can be used at a time. However, a wireless network connection and Wi-Fi Direct connection, or a wired network connection (supported models only) and Wi-Fi Direct connection can be used at the same time. Before configuring wireless settings, you must know your Network name (SSID) and Network Key.';

The following is important information for using I-Fax: Factors such as the receiver\'s location, structure of the LAN and how busy the circuit (such as the Internet) is may cause the system to take a longer time than usual to send an error mail. When sending confidential documents, we recommend using standard phone lines instead of the Internet (due to its low level of security). If the receiver\'s mail system is not MIME-compatible, you cannot use I-Fax to send documents. If possible, find out in advance, and note that some servers will not send an error reply.

If you do not want your print server configured via DHCP, you must set the Boot Method to Static so that the print server has a static IP address.

contents[	529	]='Configure the IP Address Using BOOTP Before you configure the IP address using Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), you must set the machine\'s Boot Method to BOOTP. To change the Boot Method, use the machine\'s control panel Network menu, BRAdmin applications, or Remote Setup (for MFC models). BOOTP is an alternative to Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) that has the advantage of allowing configuration of the subnet mask and gateway. To use BOOTP to configure the IP address, make sure BOOTP is installed and running on your host computer (it should appear in the \/etc\/services file on your host as a real service; type man bootpd or see your system documentation for information). BOOTP is usually started up via the \/etc\/inetd.conf file, so you may need to enable it by removing the "#" in front of the bootp entry in that file. For example, a typical bootp entry in the \/etc\/inetd.conf file would be: #bootp dgram udp wait \/usr\/etc\/bootpd bootpd -i Depending on the system, this entry might be called "bootps" instead of “bootp”. To enable BOOTP, use an editor to delete the "#" (if there is no "#," then BOOTP is already enabled). Then edit the BOOTP configuration file (usually \/etc\/bootptab) and enter the name, network type (1 for Ethernet), MAC Address (Ethernet Address) and the IP address, subnet mask and gateway of the print server. Unfortunately, the exact format for doing this is not standardized, so you will need to see your system documentation to determine how to enter this information (many UNIX® systems also have template examples in the bootptab file that you can use for reference). Some examples of typical \/etc\/bootptab entries include: ("BRN" below is "BRW" for a wireless network.) BRN310107 1 00:80:77:31:01:07 192.168.1.2 and: BRN310107:ht=ethernet:ha=008077310107:\\ip=192.168.1.2: Certain BOOTP host software implementations will not respond to BOOTP requests if you have not included a download filename in the configuration file. If this is the case, create a null file on the host and specify the name of this file and its path in the configuration file. As with RARP, the print server will load its IP address from the BOOTP server when the machine is powered on.';

To change the Boot Method, use the machine\'s control panel, BRAdmin applications, Remote Setup (for MFC models), or Web Based Management. The Brother print server\'s IP address can be configured using the RARP facility on your host computer. This is done by editing the \/etc\/ethers file (if this file does not exist, you can create it) with an entry similar to the following: 00:80:77:31:01:07 BRN008077310107 (or BRW008077310107 for a wireless network) where the first entry is the MAC Address (Ethernet Address) of the print server and the second entry is the name of the print server.

The ARP command is available on Windows® systems that have TCP\/IP installed and UNIX® systems. To use ARP, type the following command: arp -s ipaddress ethernetaddress ipaddress Where ethernetaddress is the MAC Address (Ethernet Address) of the print server and ipaddress is the IP address of the print server. For example: Windows® systems Windows® systems require the hyphen (dash) "-" character between each digit of the MAC Address (Ethernet Address). arp -s 192.168.1.2 00-80-77-31-01-07 ping 192.168.1.2 UNIX®\/Linux systems Typically, UNIX® and Linux systems require the colon ":" character between each digit of the MAC Address (Ethernet Address). arp -s 192.168.1.2 00:80:77:31:01:07 ping 192.168.1.2 You must be on the same Ethernet segment to use the ARP command, that is, there cannot be a router between the print server and operating system. If there is a router, you may use BOOTP or other methods to enter the IP address. If your administrator has configured the system to deliver IP addresses using BOOTP, DHCP, or RARP, your Brother print server can receive an IP address from any one of these IP address allocation systems, so you will not need to use the ARP command. The ARP command works only once. For security reasons, when you have successfully configured the IP address of a Brother print server using the ARP command, you cannot use the ARP command again to change the address. The print server will ignore any attempts to do this. To change the IP address again, use Web Based Management, or perform a factory reset on the print server, which will then allow you to use the ARP command again.';

contents[	537	]='TCP\/IPIf you connect the machine to your network with a network cable, use the Wired LAN menu selections. If you connect the machine to a wireless Ethernet network, use the WLAN menu selections. Boot Method This selection controls how the machine obtains an IP address. Auto In this mode, the machine will scan the network for a DHCP server. If it can find one, and if the DHCP server is configured to allocate an IP address to the machine, then the IP address supplied by the DHCP server will be used. If no DHCP server is available, the IP Address is set using the APIPA protocol. After the machine is initially powered ON, it may take a few minutes for the machine to scan the network for a server. Static In this mode, the machine\'s IP address must be manually assigned. When the IP address is entered, it is locked to the assigned address. If you do not want your print server configured via DHCP, BOOTP, or RARP, you must set the BOOT Method to Static so that the print server has a static IP address. This will prevent the print server from trying to obtain an IP address from any of these systems. To change the BOOT Method, use the machine\'s control panel, BRAdmin Light, Web Based Management, or Remote Setup. IP Address This field displays the current IP address of the machine. If you have selected a BOOT Method of Static, type the IP address that you wish to assign to the machine (check with your network administrator for the IP address to use). If you have selected a method other than Static, the machine will attempt to determine its IP address using the DHCP, BOOTP, or RARP protocols. The default IP address of your machine will probably be incompatible with the IP address numbering scheme of your network. We recommend contacting your network administrator for an IP address that is compatible with the network to which your machine is connected. Subnet Mask This field displays the current subnet mask used by the machine. If you are not using DHCP, BOOTP, or RARP to obtain the subnet mask, type the desired subnet mask. Check with your network administrator for the subnet mask to use. Gateway This field displays the current gateway or router address used by the machine. If you are not using DHCP, BOOTP, or RARP to obtain the gateway or router address, type the address you wish to assign. If you do not have a gateway or router, leave this field blank. Check with your network administrator if you are unsure. Node Name You can register the machine name on the Network. This name is often referred to as a NetBIOS name; it will be the name that is registered by the Windows® Internet Name Service (WINS) server on your network. Brother recommends the name "BRNxxxxxxxxxxxx" for a wired network or "BRWxxxxxxxxxxxx" for a wireless network (where "xxxxxxxxxxxx" is your machine\'s MAC Address \/Ethernet Address) (up to 32 characters). WINS Configuration This selection controls how the machine obtains the IP address of the WINS server. Auto Automatically uses a DHCP request to determine the IP addresses for the primary and secondary WINS servers. You must set the BOOT Method to Auto or DHCP for this feature to work. Static Uses a specified IP address for the primary and secondary WINS servers. WINS Server This selection manages the IP address of the WINS server. Primary (Primary WINS Server IP Address) This field specifies the IP address of the primary WINS server. If set to a non-zero value, the machine will contact this server to register its name with the Windows® Internet Name Service. Secondary (Secondary WINS Server IP Address) This field specifies the IP address of the secondary WINS server. It is used as a backup to the primary WINS server address. If the primary WINS server is unavailable, the machine still can register itself with a secondary server. If set to a non-zero value, the machine will contact this server to register its name with the Windows® Internet Name Service. If you have a primary WINS server but no secondary WINS server, simply leave this field blank. DNS Server This selection manages the IP address of the Domain Name System (DNS) server. Primary (Primary DNS Server IP Address) This field specifies the IP address of the primary DNS server. Secondary (Secondary DNS Server IP Address) This field specifies the IP address of the secondary DNS server. It is used as a backup to the primary DNS server address. If the primary DNS server is unavailable, the machine will contact the secondary DNS server. APIPA Selecting On will cause the print server to automatically allocate a link-local IP address in the range (169.254.1.0 - 169.254.254.255) when the print server cannot obtain an IP address through the Boot Method you have set. Selecting Off means the IP address does not change when the print server cannot obtain an IP address through the Boot Method you have set. IPv6 This machine is compatible with IPv6, the next generation Internet protocol. The default setting is Off. If you want to use the IPv6 protocol, select On. For more information on the IPv6 protocol, go to the Brother Solutions Center at http:\/\/support.brother.com. If you set IPv6 to On, turn off the power switch, and then turn it back on to enable this protocol. After you set IPv6 to On, this setting will be applied to both the wired and wireless LAN interface. Boot MethodIP AddressSubnet MaskGatewayNode NameWINS ConfigurationWINS ServerDNS ServerAPIPAIPv6';

We have three selections for SNMP Mode of Operation. SNMP v1\/v2c read-write access In this mode, the print server uses version 1 and version 2c of the SNMP protocol. You can use all Brother applications under this mode. However, it is not secure since it will not authenticate the user and the data will not be encrypted.

shortdesc[	608	]='';
contents[	608	]='Telephone and Fax Problems Telephone Line or Connections Difficulties Suggestions Dialling does not work. (No dial tone) Check all line cord connections. Make sure the telephone line cord is plugged into the telephone wall socket and the LINE socket of the machine. If you subscribe to DSLor VoIP services, contact your service provider for connection instructions. (Available only for some countries.) Change the Tone\/Pulse setting. If an external phone is connected to the machine, send a manual fax by lifting the handset of the external telephone and dialling the number using the external telephone. Wait to hear the fax receiving tones before sending fax. If there is no dial tone, connect a known working telephone and telephone line cord to the socket. Then lift the external telephone’s handset and listen for a dial tone. If there is still no dial tone, ask your telephone company to check the line and\/or wall socket. The machine does not answer when called. Make sure the machine is in the correct receive mode for your setup. Check for a dial tone. If possible, call your machine to hear it answer. If there is still no answer, check that the telephone line cord is plugged into the telephone wall socket and the LINE socket of the machine. If there is no ringing when you call your machine, ask your telephone company to check the line. Handling Incoming Calls Difficulties Suggestions The machine ‘Hears’ a voice as a CNG Tone. If Fax Detect is set to On, your machine is more sensitive to sounds. It may mistakenly interpret certain voices or music on the line as a fax machine calling and respond with fax receiving tones. Deactivate the machine by pressing Stop\/Exit or . Try avoiding this problem by turning Fax Detect to Off. Sending a Fax Call to the machine. If you answered on an extension or external telephone, press your Remote Activation Code (the factory setting is *51). If you answered on the external telephone, press Start button to receive the fax. When your machine answers, hang up. Custom features on a single line. If you have Call Waiting, Call Waiting\/Caller ID, Caller ID, Voice Mail, an answering machine, an alarm system or other custom feature on a single telephone line with your machine, it may create a problem sending or receiving faxes. For Example: If you subscribe to Call Waiting or some other custom service and its signal comes through the line while your machine is sending or receiving a fax, the signal can temporarily interrupt or disrupt the faxes. Brother’s ECM (Error Correction Mode) feature should help overcome this problem. This condition is related to the telephone system industry and is common to all devices that send and receive information on a single, shared line with custom features. If avoiding a slight interruption is crucial to your business, we recommend using a separate telephone line with no custom features. Receiving Faxes Difficulties Suggestions Cannot receive a fax. Check all line cord connections. Make sure the telephone line cord is plugged into the telephone wall socket and the LINE socket of the machine. If you subscribe to DSLor VoIP services, contact your service provider for connection instructions. To lower the modem speed and turn off ECM (error correction mode), change the telephone line interference \/ VoIP settings. Make sure the machine is in the correct Receive Mode. This is determined by the external devices and telephone subscriber services you have on the same line as the Brother machine. If you have a dedicated fax line and want your Brother machine to automatically answer all incoming faxes, you should select Fax only mode. If your Brother machine shares a line with an external answering machine, you should select the External TAD mode. In External TAD mode, your Brother machine will automatically receive incoming faxes and voice callers will be able to leave a message on your answering machine. If your Brother machine shares a line with other telephones and you want it to automatically answer all incoming faxes, you should select the Fax\/Tel mode. In Fax\/Tel mode, your Brother machine will automatically receive faxes and produce a fast double-ring to alert you to answer voice calls. If you do not want your Brother machine to automatically answer any incoming faxes, you should select the Manual mode. In Manual mode, you must answer every incoming call and activate the machine to receive faxes. Another device or service at your location may be answering the call before your Brother machine answers. To test this, lower the ring delay setting: If the Receive Mode is set to Fax Only or Fax\/Tel, reduce the Ring Delay to 1 ring. See Related Information: Set the Number of Rings Before the Machine Answers (Ring Delay) If the Receive Mode is set to External TAD, reduce the number of rings programmed on your answering machine to 2. If the Receive Mode is set to Manual, DO NOT adjust the Ring Delay setting. Have someone send you a test fax: If you received the test fax successfully, your machine is operating correctly. Remember to reset your Ring Delay or answering machine setting back to your original setting. If receiving problems recur after resetting the Ring Delay, then a person, device, or subscriber service is answering the fax call before the machine has a chance to answer. If you were not able to receive the fax, then another device or subscriber service may be interfering with your fax reception or there may be a problem with your fax line. If you are using a telephone answering machine (External TAD mode) on the same line as the Brother machine, make sure your answering machine is set up correctly. Set your answering machine to answer in one or two rings. Record the outgoing message on your answering machine. Record five seconds of silence at the beginning of your outgoing message. Limit your speaking to 20 seconds. End your outgoing message with your Remote Activation Code for people sending manual faxes. For example: “After the beep, leave a message or press *51 and Start to send a fax.” Set your answering machine to answer calls. Set your Brother machine’s Receive Mode to External TAD. See Related Information: Choose the Correct Receive Mode Make sure your Brother machine’s Fax Detect feature is turned On. Fax Detect is a feature that allows you to receive a fax even if you answered the call on an external or extension telephone. If you often get transmission errors due to possible interference on the telephone line, try changing the Compatibility setting to Basic(for VoIP). Contact your administrator to check your Secure Function Lock Settings. Sending Faxes Difficulties Suggestions Cannot send a fax. Check all line cord connections. Make sure the telephone line cord is plugged into the telephone wall socket and the LINE socket of the machine. If you subscribe to DSLor VoIP services, contact your service provider for connection instructions. Make sure you pressed Fax and the machine is in Fax mode. Print the Transmission Verification Report and check for an error. Contact your administrator to check your Secure Function Lock Settings. Ask the other party to check that the receiving machine has paper. Poor sending quality. Try changing your resolution to Fine or S.Fine. Make a copy to check your machine’s scanner operation. If the copy quality is not good, clean the scanner. Transmission Verification Report says RESULT:ERROR. There is probably temporary noise or static on the line. Try sending the fax again. If you are sending a PC-Fax message and get RESULT:ERROR on the Transmission Verification Report, your machine may be out of memory. To free up extra memory, you can turn off fax storage, print fax messages in memory or cancel a delayed fax or polling job. If the problem continues, ask the telephone company to check your telephone line. If you often get transmission errors due to possible interference on the telephone line, try changing the Compatibility setting to Basic(for VoIP). Sent faxes are blank. Make sure you are loading the document correctly. When using the ADF, the document should be face up. When using the scanner glass, the document should be face down. Vertical black lines when sending. Black vertical lines on faxes you send are typically caused by dirt or correction fluid on the glass strip. Clean the glass strip. Printing received faxes Difficulties Suggestions Condensed print Horizontal streaks Top and bottom sentences are cut off Missing lines This is usually caused by a poor telephone connection. Make a copy; if your copy looks good, you probably had a bad connection, with static or interference on the telephone line. Ask the other party to send the fax again. Vertical black lines when receiving The corona wire for printing may be dirty. Clean the corona wire in the drum unit. The sender’s scanner may be dirty. Ask the sender to make a copy to see if the problem is with the sending machine. Try receiving from another fax machine. Received faxes appear as split or blank pages.

Discard used consumable items according to local regulations, keeping it separate from domestic waste. If you have questions, call your local waste disposal office. Be sure to reseal the consumable items tightly so that the material inside does not spill. We recommend placing used supplies on a piece of paper to prevent accidentally spilling or scattering the material inside. If you use paper that is not a direct equivalent for the recommended print media, the life of supplies and machine parts may be reduced. The projected life for each of the toner cartridges is based on ISO\/IEC 19752. Frequency of replacement will vary depending on the print volume, percentage of coverage, types of media used, and powering on\/off the machine. Frequency of replacement supplies except toner cartridges will vary depending on the print volume, types of media used, and powering on\/off the machine. Handle the toner cartridge carefully. If toner scatters on your hands or clothes, immediately wipe or wash it off with cold water.

To ensure high quality printing, we recommend using only Brother Original toner cartridges. When you want to buy toner cartridges, contact Brother Dealer. DO NOT unpack the new toner cartridge until you are ready to install it. If a toner cartridge is left unpacked for a long time, the toner life will be shortened. Brother strongly recommends you DO NOT refill the toner cartridge provided with your machine. We also strongly recommend you continue to use only Brother Original replacement toner cartridges. Use or attempted use of third party toner and\/or cartridges in the Brother machine may cause damage to the machine and\/or may result in unsatisfactory print quality. Our limited warranty coverage does not apply to any problem that is caused by the use of third party toner and\/or cartridges. To protect your investment and obtain premium performance from the Brother machine, we strongly recommend the use of Brother Original Supplies.';

shortdesc[	649	]='';
contents[	649	]='Learn About The Drum Unit Model name DR-2305 A new drum unit can print approximately 12,000 A4 or Letter size single-sided pages. Drum wear and tear occurs due to use and rotation of the drum and interaction with paper, toner and other materials in the paper path. In designing this product, Brother decided to use the number of rotations of the drum as a reasonable determinant of the drum life. When a drum reaches the factory-established rotation limit corresponding to the rated page yield, the product’s LCD will advise you to replace the applicable drum. The product will continue to function; however, print quality may not be optimal. If an unpacked drum unit is placed in direct sunlight (or room light for long periods of time), the unit may be damaged. There are many factors that determine the actual drum life, such as the temperature, humidity, type of paper, type of toner used and so on. Under ideal conditions, the average drum life is estimated at approximately 12,000 pages. The actual number of pages that your drum will print may be significantly less than this estimate. Because we have no control over the many factors that determine the actual drum life, we cannot guarantee a minimum number of pages that will be printed by your drum. For best performance, use only Brother Original toner. The machine should be used only in a clean, dust-free environment with adequate ventilation. Printing with a non-Brother drum unit may reduce not only the print quality but also the quality and life of the machine itself. Warranty coverage does not apply to problems caused by the use of a non-Brother drum unit.';
